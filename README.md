# neural_network_challenge_1

In this challenge, we focused on creating and training a neural network to better understand student loans. 

Through this challenge, we utilized tools including, train_test_split and scalar; as well as accuracy scores.

Finally, we also utilized neurons / nodes and model_file_path, saving the file as a .keras.

What I found most interesting in our challenge was our classification report, our averages weren't the best (since most companies for instance evaluate at accuracy rate of 95% - 99%.) I found this interesting and believe that some features in our original data could have been removed to increase accuracy.
